      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>
        The Ruby Casino is a simple casino app that allows you to play three different games.
        <br/>
        You can play <u>slots</u>, <u>high/low</u>, and <u>guess-the-total</u>!
        <br/>
        This was for a school project. It's a fairly simple app that we made in a couple days.
