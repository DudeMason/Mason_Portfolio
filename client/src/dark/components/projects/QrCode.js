        She's a graphic designer and was looking for QR codes
        for business cards she was desiging for a client.
        She couldn't find any free generators online
        so she looked at me and said, "Your doing coding and stuff now, can't you make one?"
        <br/>
          I was just as curious, and wa-lah!
