# My Portfolio Website

This is a website representing my portfolio! It contains links to my finished projects and some info about me.

It also contains small blog posts about where I am in my career. I might not update it very often :/ hehe

It's written using ReactJS on Rails, using languages such as RUBY, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
