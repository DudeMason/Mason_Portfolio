				At school we had something called a hackathon.
				In a hackathon we form groups of three and attempt
				to make a full scale website within 6 hours.
				<br/>
				The website we made was a trip planner.
				Something that allows you to easily plan trips, destinations, and specific locations.
				At the end of the hackathon the school announces the winner based on the set criteria.
			</p>
			<p>
				Drum roll......... <strong>We won!!</strong>

				The project has been launched on its own website.
